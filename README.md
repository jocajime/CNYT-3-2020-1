# COMPLEX NUMBER CALCULATOR
Different libraries are kept in this repository that help us in the implementation and understanding of quantum systems.
For this purpose, the following libraries are kept:
- cal_complejos
- sistema_cuantico
- simulacion_cuantico
- partlcula_en_una_linea
in these the complex numbers are represented as (a, b) a being the integer part and b representing the imaginary part.
accompanied by these there is one that tests the correct operation of the libraries.

-cal_complejos:
performs basic operations on complex numbers, vectors and complex matrices.

- simulacion_cuantica:
gives functions to show results of double slit experiment

- sistema_cuantico:
It proposes functions for the understanding of quantum systems.

-partlcula_en_una_linea
provides function to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a position.

# Getting Started
- Download the file librerias found in this repository.
- Save the file in the same place as the project in which you want to implement it.
# Prerequisites
to use this library you need to have python 3.7 installed on your computer
- import the relevant libraries into your computer
- place them in the same project folder where you need them
# Running the tests
To run the tests of this library:
- download the file corresponding to each of the libraries
- We save this file in the same location as our library and we run it.
- All these tests must be correct.
# Break down into end to end tests
These tests analyze the correct functioning of the different operations implemented in this library.
